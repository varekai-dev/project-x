					</p>
					<h2>
						<strong>
							What are the criteria for choosing the best online casinos?
						</strong>
					</h2>
					<p>
						It is often difficult to choose from all the offers available on the
						market, but it is especially difficult to sort through reliable and
						fraudulent online casinos. To answer all your questions and guide
						you through the complex world of online casino gambling, Lucky7Bonus
						has listed below the right questions to ask and criteria to take
						into account before registering at a casino.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>
							Is there a large selection of slot machines and providers?
						</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						The quality of an online casino can be judged by the number of slots
						available on its platform. If you can find the main players like
						Play'n GO, Evolution Gaming, or Pragmatic Play, you are on the right
						track. From one, you have a wide choice of games and from two, the
						online casino proves that it is ready to put the price to offer
						content to its players. Let's take the example of Casino Extra: the
						casino offers you a very wide choice of slot machines that allows
						you to spend various sessions at their place and never get bored!
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Is it easy to open an account at an online casino?</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Today, registering at an online casino is child's play. At Cresus
						Casino, for example, all you have to do is fill in your personal
						information and you're ready to play! Be careful to fill in the
						fields seriously and with your real information. If you place a
						withdrawal on your account, you will be asked for your personal
						documents to validate your identity. If the documents you send to
						the online casino prove to be false in relation to your registration
						information, you will be unable to make the withdrawal. The ease and
						security of this process is essentially the same for all casinos.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Is it possible to play anything other than slots?</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Yes, you can very well play live games like blackjack, roulette,
						crazy time or Monopoly. With your money deposited with no bonus,
						there is no problem. However, if you decide to take one of the
						bonuses, as offered at Lucky7Bonus, you should always read the terms
						and conditions. While some online casinos will not allow you to play
						games other than slots, some online casinos may accept it. However,
						the maximum bet is 5 euros, if you have taken a bonus. If you exceed
						this amount, the online casino may confiscate your balance for
						failure to comply with the terms and conditions. We can only advise
						you to read the bonus terms and conditions on each online casino, as
						they differ from platform to platform.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, if you have a deposit bonus at Casino Extra online
						casino, the maximum wager will be €5. If you decide to make a
						blackjack hand, you cannot exceed this €5 on your entire wager. So
						you will not be able to make anyone draw or stay. It is therefore
						very important to pay attention to the conditions set up at the
						casinos you use.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Are the payment methods secure?</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						At every online casino promoted by Lucky7Bonus, payment methods are
						secure. These range from credit cards to paysafecard and
						cryptocurrencies. Payments are handled as if you were buying an item
						from an online shop. As far as the withdrawals are concerned, no
						other person than you will be able to benefit from your balance.
						Your account at an online casino is linked to your personal
						information and if a withdrawal is made in the name of someone other
						than you, it will be blocked by the casino staff.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>What license does the online casino have?</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Every online casino must have a gaming license in order to operate
						in their market. The most common license that exists is a license
						issued in Curaçao by the Master Gaming Licence CIL (Curaçao
						Interactive Licensing N.V.). This compulsory license is given to
						online casinos that have proven that their platform is reliable and
						meets all the criteria set by the legislators. This prevents
						fraudulent online casinos from operating or abusing certain players.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>What are the bonuses and their conditions?</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Bonuses offered by online casinos are often deposit bonuses under
						certain conditions. At Fatboss we offer you a +100% bonus of up to
						€50 on your first deposit. If you accept this bonus, you must comply
						with the casino rules, which include: the maximum wager allowed, the
						minimum deposit amount, or the number of times you must play the
						bonus money in order to request a withdrawal.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Which online casinos offer the best bonuses?</strong>
					</h3>

					<h3>
						<strong>Is the customer service efficient?</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Of course, some online casinos have better customer service than
						others. Along with promotions, this is one of the most important
						points that differentiate one online casino from another. The
						majority of online casinos often have a live chat with schedules
						that allow you to ask questions directly to a trained agent. You
						also have the option of contacting customer service via email or by
						phone for some online casinos. When talking about the efficiency of
						this service, we can only take the example of Cbet. The agents
						behind this service are extremely friendly and will answer all your
						questions. If you would like to know what we think about the
						customer service at a specific casino, you can go straight to the
						Lucky7Bonus review of that casino here!
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>Is the online casino playable on mobile phones?</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Generally speaking, all online casinos have a mobile version of
						their platform, which is accessible on Android and Apple devices.
						Some of them offer a mobile application, but make sure that the
						application comes from the official website of the online casino and
						not from malicious people. The best thing to do is to ask customer
						services directly if they have a mobile application or simply a site
						that is 100% compatible with mobile devices.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>
							How long does it take for a withdrawal from the online casino to
							reach my bank account?
						</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						In most cases, online casinos take more or less two business days to
						validate your withdrawals. After that, everything happens at your
						bank, so you can often add another day for the money to appear in
						your account. On average the wait is three days. However, with
						Bitcasino, withdrawals can take between 5 to 15 minutes to arrive at
						your cryptocurrency wallet. The transaction time depends greatly on
						the cryptocurrency you are using and the blockchain.
