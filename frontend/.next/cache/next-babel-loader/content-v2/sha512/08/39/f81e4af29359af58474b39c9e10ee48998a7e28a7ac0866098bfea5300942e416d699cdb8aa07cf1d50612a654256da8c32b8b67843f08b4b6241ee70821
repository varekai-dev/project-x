To do this, we look at what\r\n              we know about you so that we can refine the offers we present to\r\n              you.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              <strong>Giving you control</strong>\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We strongly believe that our clients prefer offers and information\r\n              tailored to them and their areas of interest rather than general\r\n              advertising. We therefore adapt all our marketing to the image we\r\n              have built of you. We believe that this makes our marketing\r\n              better, both for you and for us. However, data protection law\r\n              gives you the right to refuse to allow your personal data to be\r\n              used to create that image of you and to predict what might be of\r\n              interest to you. You can therefore refuse at any time. As we\r\n              explain above, our marketing is designed in this way for you. To\r\n              opt-out of this type of personalization, you will need to opt-out\r\n              of all {contactInfo.name} email services to which you subscribe,\r\n              but we will continue to personalize your online experience based\r\n              on the image we have already created of you. This means that you\r\n              will continue to enjoy a more personalized look and feel on our\r\n              websites and you will always see the following:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Targeted pop-ups informing you of products, services and offers\r\n                we think you'll like\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Tailor-made offers that are relevant to you, communicated\r\n                through pop-ups or other website content\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Targeted messages on social media platforms such as Facebook or\r\n                Twitter (which you can easily control via your privacy settings\r\n                on each platform) and other places on the internet that support\r\n                targeted advertising.\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              So we think this is the best balance: It allows you to opt out of\r\n              receiving marketing via offline channels (post, email and SMS)\r\n              while enjoying the best online experience without having to give\r\n              up the benefits.
